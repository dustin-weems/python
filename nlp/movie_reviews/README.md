# **Movie Reviews**

*"I think you have to write the film that you want to see, and try and do it honestly, and you can’t control people’s responses, really."* **-Edgar Wright**

## Overview
This project explores a few different approaches to sentiment analysis using movie reviews.  The goal was to better understand the performance between methods on a relevant dataset, whether cleaning the data improved performance, and the tradeoff between performance and compute time.
