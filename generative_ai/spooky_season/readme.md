# **Spooky Season**

*“We make up horrors to help us cope with the real ones.”* **- Stephen King**

## Overview
This project was a fun introduction to `langchain` and Stability AI's endpoint for stable diffusion.  I have zero artistic ability, so it was satisfying to use a large language model to generate well-written prompts and produce some really cool images.  I will likely revisit this project in the future, perhaps during next October. :jack_o_lantern:  My Instagram page is linked below for those interested in following along.
