# **Superinvestors**

*“It is remarkable how much long-term advantage people like us have gotten by trying to be consistently not stupid, instead of trying to be very intelligent.”* **- Charlie Munger**

## Overview
This project served as my first experience using `streamlit` to build a dashboard.  I began with a simple concept - visualize the quarterly portfolio allocations of my favorite investors.  Currently, the dashboard only updates based on investor name.  In future quarters, I will add more data such that the quarter can be changed, too.  Below is a screenshot of the dashboard, which can be accessed [here](https://superinvestor-portfolios.streamlit.app/).
