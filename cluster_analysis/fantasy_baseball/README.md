# **Fantasy Baseball**

*“Just keep going. Everybody gets better if they keep at it.”* **- Ted Williams**

## Overview
In one of my fantasy baseball leagues, teams compete on a weekly basis across ten statistical categories.  Half of these categories are specific to batters, the others are specific to pitchers.  This analysis will focus on the batting categories only.  They are:
* Runs (R)
* Home Runs (HR)
* Runs Batted In (RBI)
* Stolen Bases (SB)
* Batting Average (AVG)

The goal is to win as many of these categories as possible each week.  I will forego the definitions of each category and instead emphasize that "winning" a category means achieving a larger value than your opponent in that given category.  

Before each season begins, the fantasy baseball league members will come together for a draft where we select our players for the upcoming year.  For the past two seasons, I have been using a cluster analysis to create tiers using full season projections to inform my batter rankings.  There is generally a top tier with players that either contribute strongly to all five categories or show dominance in a few of the categories without poor showings in the others.  

This top tier is very helpful to my draft strategy, allowing me to narrow the prospective player pool to a subset that will make me highly competitive across all batting categories.  There are many players that a baseball fan would expect to see in the top tier, but there are others that have been less obvious.  This strategy has paid off as I have won my league's championship the last two years.
